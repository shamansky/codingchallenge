I have used create-react-app to create the files and Jest to test the Javascript function.
The file that has the Javascript function is called "challenge.js" and the tests are to be found in "challenge.test.js"

Please follow these steps to run the tests:  

1.Type yarn install in the terminal to install dependencies.

2.Type yarn test to run the tests that Ive created for the Javascript function.






P.S. : 
Im not sure I understood the second requirement, I feel like im missing something : 

Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder.

 groupArrayElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3);
 // [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5 ] ]
 
 What do you mean by "the final part" ? In the example provided we have 3 arrays and the final one has the length of 1. The whole array has a length of 3. The remainder of 5/3 = 2 so does it mean the length of the last array should be 2 or the whole array's length should be 2? I'm sorry but Im not sure what it was required of me but if you provided further info Im happy to add an If statement and keep working on it. 
 
 Thank you for the opportunity!
